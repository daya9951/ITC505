        <h1>Cybersecurity Threats: Emerging Challenges and Solutions</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, affecting individuals, organizations, and governments. This paper examines common threats and effective mitigation strategies.</p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity, Phishing, Ransomware, Data Breaches, Network Security</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As digital transformation accelerates, cybersecurity threats such as malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated.</p>

        <h2>Common Threats</h2>
        <p>Phishing attacks exploit human error, while ransomware encrypts critical data, demanding payment for recovery. Organizations must implement strong security measures to mitigate risks.</p>

        <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <p>Using multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, and employee training significantly reduces vulnerabilities. AI-driven security systems enhance threat detection and response.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity remains a crucial aspect of digital operations. Proactive strategies and emerging technologies can mitigate risks and protect sensitive data.</p>
